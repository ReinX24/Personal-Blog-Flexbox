    Counter Strike, a game where two teams containing of 5 players each fight on various maps and game modes, the most known one being bomb defusal.
    Ever since Counter Strike was released as a mod for Half-Life at November 9, 2000, it has been a game that has been close to the hearts of first-person shooter players.
    It is a game that test things such as teamwork, aim, game sense, economy usage, movement, and other skills that are present in these shooter games.

    When I first played the game on my mother's old Dell laptop, I immediately got hooked on the way the game works even though I was only playing against bots.
    I specifically played the 1.6 version of the game, the game's version that was most stable and updated. 
    But as time went on I eventually grew bored of playing with and against bots since I felt that the matches I played didn't improve the way I played the game.

    Because of this discontent, I eventually moved on and played other shooters like Crossfire and Point Blank, games that were multiplayer but didn't exacltly have the same charm of Counter Strike.
    That was when I discovered CS:GO (Counter Strike Global Offensive) and asked my dad to buy me the game for 500+ pesos when it was still paid back then.
    I would go to a computer shop in the downtown area of our city to play the game since computer shops near where I lived didn't have powerful enough computers to play the game on smoothly.

    I would arrive at the computer shop where I played the game at 7 in the morning and would play until 5 in the afternoon with my friends who also play in the same computer shop.
    Playing Counter Strike has taught me the importance of practice, how teamwork could make or break games, how to be involved in the community, and many more lessons.
    So to anyone reading this who is afraid to play Counter Strike due to its somewhat elitist nature, I suggest that you give it a try for its cold hard image teaches one special lessons that sometimes could only be learned in specific circumstances.
