    Valorant, a game by Riot Games has been the epicenter of the different friendships that I have made throughout this pandemic. 
    It had mechanics that were similar to Counter Strike, another game that I am fond of but is not exactly suited for everyone.
    But this all took a turn when Valorant released, due to the game's nature of being beginnner friendly, me and my friends immediately picked the game up
    and played together.

    As time went on, me and my friends got better at the game, we learned team composition, lineups, different strategies, and many more.
    But as we got better, our standards from each game got higher, we played more carefully rather than being careless, which lead to cleaner games than when we were plebs.
    With our increase in skill, tensions also grew since we expected more from each other than when we were new to the game, and sometimes, this causes rifts between us.

    While we are now past our "try hard" days, I still love the things I learned from taking something seriously with your friends.
    One thing that I have learned is that while we may have been playing with each other on the same timeline, not everyone has the same amount of skill as the other 
    person, and that instead of berating them for their lack of skill, we should instead help them get better at the game through practice.
    Another thing that I have learned is that it is ok to lose sometimes, for losing means that we still have a lot of room to grow. 
    Playing a game where you always win does sound kind of boring, doesn't it?

    Lastly, and probably the most important thing that I have learned from playing the game, is the importance of having friends.
    There were times where I just play by myself since everyone is busy, and let me tell you, playing a multiplayer game without friends feel, ironically, lonely.
    This is where I realized that it doesn't matter much if I win or lose games, and that what truly matters is that you enjoy your time with friends.
    "Nice Try, Nice Wall, & Nice Game", those words, while simple, are the pillars of our friendship, for they represent our trust and respect with each other, something that will eternally be priceless.
